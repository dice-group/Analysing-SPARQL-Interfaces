# Analysing-SPARQL-Interfaces
Run time performance measurement of SPARQL querying interfaces

SPARQL Endpoints are the interfaces where users can perform queries and get the results in the form of triples. Query engines or RDF Triple Stores reside in the back-end of these endpoints, which are reposible for processing the queries and generating the results. Apart from this, there are some other interfaces as well, where clients and servers both contribute to process the SPARQL queries. In this work we are going to analyse such interfaces for their run time performance by using Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) benchmark dataset of different sizes, i.e. ten and hundred millions triples. These quering interfaces are analysed based on different SPARQL query features, as provided by Linked SPARQL Queries Dataset (LSQ) like No. of triple patterns, No. of projection variables, No. of join vertices, and result size (may be we add some more features). The interfaces we analyse are, Star Pattern Fragemnts, Smart KG, Wise KG, brTPF and Lined Data Fragments. Some of the results are ready while other will be available soon.
